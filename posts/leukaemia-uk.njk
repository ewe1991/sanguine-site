  <p>Britain’s two largest leukaemia organisations, Leukaemia U.K and Leukaemia Care, called on us to deliver their campaign for Blood Cancer Awareness Month, raising awareness of the 3 key symptoms of leukaemia.</p>

  <p>With Covid symptoms ingrained on everyone’s minds, a radical advertising approach would be required to divert attention to a completely new set of serious symptoms. Brave and colourful, our campaign centred around a blue-and-gold macaw creating a piece of music to make the symptoms memorable.</p>

  <p>The campaign generated 10 million impressions and provoked a 12% increase in leukaemia enquiries via the NHS.</p>
