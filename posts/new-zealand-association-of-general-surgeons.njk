      <p>We were engaged by the New Zealand Association of General Surgeons to promote their 2022 conference ‘Synergy in Surgery’. As the subject of the conference was emerging technologies, we created a a digital campaign that asked surgeons a pointed and ineludible question: Could AI cut you out of surgery? The campaign launched with an online banner in which a simulated artificially intelligent surgeon appeared to be second away from operating on her first patient. The campaign attracted an additional guest speaker and resulted in a record number of registrations. </p>
